This code is a simple Discord bot written in Python using the discord.py library. Below is a detailed explanation of how it works.
Overview

This script defines a Discord bot that listens for messages in a server or direct messages. If a message starts with ?, the bot responds privately (via DM); otherwise, it responds in the same channel where the message was sent. The bot fetches responses from a separate responses module.
Code Breakdown

   - Importing Required Modules

import discord
import responses
import os

   - discord: The discord.py library is used to interact with Discord's API.
   - responses: A custom module (not included in this script) that handles generating responses to user messages.
   - os: Used to retrieve the bot token from environment variables to keep it secure.

   - Function to Send Messages

async def send_message(message, user_message, is_private):
try:
response = responses.get_response(user_message)
await message.author.send(response) if is_private else await message.channel.send(response)
except Exception as e:
print(e)

  -send_message Function:
  - Takes three parameters:
  - message: The message object from Discord.
  -  user_message: The actual text content of the message.
  -   is_private: Boolean to determine if the bot should reply privately (via DM) or in the channel.
  -    Calls responses.get_response(user_message) to generate an appropriate reply.
  -    Uses await message.author.send(response) to send a private message if is_private is True.
  -   Otherwise, it sends the message in the same channel with await message.channel.send(response).
  -    If any error occurs, it prints the exception.

   - Running the Bot

def run_discord_bot():
token = os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")

intents = discord.Intents.default()  
intents.message_content = True  
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)  

   - run_discord_bot Function:
   -    Retrieves the bot token from an environment variable (DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN). This avoids exposing the token in the source code.
   -    Configures intents, specifically enabling message_content so the bot can read user messages.
   -   Creates a discord.Client instance with the specified intents.

   - Handling Events

4.1 Bot Startup Event

@client.event
async def on_ready():
print(f'{client.user} is now running!')

   - Runs when the bot successfully connects to Discord.
   - Prints the bot's username to indicate that it is running.

4.2 Handling Messages

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
if message.author == client.user:
return

   - Listens for new messages in any server where the bot is present.
   - If the message is from the bot itself, it ignores it to avoid infinite loops.

username = str(message.author)
user_message = str(message.content)
channel = str(message.channel)

print(f'{username} said: "{user_message}" ({channel})')

   - Extracts and prints details about the message, including:
   -      The username of the sender.
   -    The message content.
   -     The channel where it was sent.

if user_message.startswith('?'):
user_message = user_message[1:]
await send_message(message, user_message, is_private=True)
else:
await send_message(message, user_message, is_private=False)

  -  If the message starts with ?, it removes the ? and sends a private reply via DM.
  -  Otherwise, it sends a response publicly in the same channel.

  -  Running the Bot

client.run(token)

  -  Starts the bot and connects it to Discord using the retrieved token.

How to Use This Bot

Step 1: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then install discord.py:

pip install discord

Step 2: Set Up the Environment Variable

Set the bot token securely:

On Windows (PowerShell):
$env:DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token-here"

On macOS/Linux:
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token-here"

Step 3: Run the Bot

Execute the script:

python bot.py

Step 4: Interacting with the Bot

  -  Send a message to a Discord server where the bot is present.
  -  Use ?your_message to receive a private reply.

Security Considerations

  -  Never hardcode your bot token in the script. Always use environment variables.
  -  Rate limits: Avoid spamming messages to prevent getting temporarily banned by Discord.
  -  Permissions: Ensure the bot has the correct permissions to read and send messages in a server.

Next Steps

  - Add more functionality, such as handling commands using discord.ext.commands.
  -  Improve error handling.
  -  Store message logs or implement moderation features.
